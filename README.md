# EKF-Feed-Forward-Controller-Simulation

Hello Hack the North ðŸ‘‹

Although that project may have found it's end, there's more to come! From my new position in Dr. Fani's lab at the University of Windsor, I have gained many new skills in the realm of artificial intelligence. A project I'm passionate about is implementing reinforcement learning models to solve control theory problems. Under Dr. Fani's mentorship, I'm writing a paper comparing reinforcement learning models to traditional controllers (basic PID, state space controller, Feed Forward, EKF Feed Forward, etc.) I'll be applying this to the problem of quadcopter controls, using a set o differential equations to model the control for the model to play with.
